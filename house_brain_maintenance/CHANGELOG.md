# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Fix (first live install, 2026-09-30): when the job-request branch was missing, or GitHub
  failed, every poll logged `poll failed ... Branch not found` and the update check never ran.
  A missing request branch now means "no requests" (logged once), and any GitHub fault while
  checking requests is logged once and no longer blocks update checks.
- No change to permissions, options, allowlist, update review or restore behaviour.

## 0.1.0

- First release (owner decisions D1-D9 and 2026-09-29 Maintenance-chat decisions).
- App updates: hourly check, deterministic review (low risk / risky / held), iPhone approval,
  verified single-App backup, update, health watch (App state, Core API, Supervisor health,
  dependent Apps), automatic restore of that App's backup on failure with version quarantine,
  crash-safe journal. Optional `update_mode: auto_low_risk` for bug-fix updates in a night
  window after 3 approved successes. Never Core/OS/Supervisor or itself.
- Scout jobs: `ROTATE_SCOUT_KEY` (prepare -> Broker learns the fingerprint -> activate only when
  the Broker already accepts the new key) and `RUN_SCOUT_ONCE` (result read from the Scout's
  latest-run log; only parsed fields are reported).
- Approval engine, ingress page, GitHub client, journal and HTTP helper from House Brain
  Deployer 0.2.1 (lineage in the design record).
- Base image `3.14-alpine3.24-2026.08.0` (estate base).
